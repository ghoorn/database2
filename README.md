database2
=========

database2 is not related to IBM's DB2, but a plugin for the open source online wiki [DokuWiki](http://www.dokuwiki.org).

This plugin has been developed in 2009. Back then there was an existing plugin called database. Because of that and due to little creativity on my behalf this plugin got called database2.

My initial engagement in developing this plugin was abandoned in late 2009 due to focusing onto different projects. Since then I haven't spent remarkable time in fixing the code, extending included features and more. Because of that (and inspired by a user of this plugin) I've moved the plugin's code to github in early 2013.
